LeslieTavern is an experimental desktop-oriented fork of [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern). It preserves the upstream chat and data formats while adding an Electron entry point, a modern chat interface, character memory, identity isolation, a moments prototype, and character voice features.

> The project is a runnable prototype. It is not an official SillyTavern release or a signed production distribution.

## Highlights

- Compatible with SillyTavern character cards, group chats, World Info, swipes, model adapters, and JSONL chats.
- Windows Electron workflow with one `Leslie Heaven` entry point, in-app AIRI/local-model controls, and portable-package tooling.
- A shared `models/` folder for local single-file GGUF weights. The desktop settings list discovered models under the managed KoboldCpp connection method and connect the selected model without requiring a port setting.
- Leslie memory and Persona/storyline isolation with story/reality chat lines that share only bounded memory resonance. Reality chats extract a de-fictionalized core personality, generate dynamic openings through the active API, and persist strictly plain instant messages; Moments provides a desktop-first timeline.
- Volcengine voice configuration, preview, and automatic reply playback.
- Explicit separation between source code, local user data, runtimes, backups, and distributable builds.

## Development setup

Node.js 20 or newer, npm, and Git are required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeslieH666/LeslieTavern.git
cd LeslieTavern
npm ci
npm ci --prefix src/electron
npm run start:electron
```

Run the repository checks with:

```bash
npm ci --prefix tests
npm run check:repo
npm run lint
npm run test:unit
```

## Local models

Place a single-file GGUF in `models/` or one of its subfolders. The Qwen3.5 and Peach 2.0 Q4_K_M weights each live in their own subfolder. In Leslie Heaven, open Settings → Model connection → Local API, select the model shown under KoboldCpp, and click Connect selected model. The desktop app starts or switches the tracked KoboldCpp process and applies the existing chat adapter. Use Stop local model to release resources. Automatic process control is desktop-only; Ollama, llama.cpp, other formats, and manual addresses remain under Advanced connection settings. A discovered GGUF is a load candidate, and the runtime checks architecture and available memory when starting.
