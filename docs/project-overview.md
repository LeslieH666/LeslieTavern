# Project overview

## Purpose

LeslieTavern explores a desktop-first character-chat experience while retaining SillyTavern's established chat engine and data compatibility. New behavior is implemented around the existing core wherever possible so users can continue using character cards and conversations without a forced migration.

## Architecture

```text
Electron shell
├─ System tray and background activity clock
└─ SillyTavern server
   ├─ Existing chat, character, group, World Info, model, and JSONL flows
   ├─ Leslie identity service
   ├─ Leslie memory service
   ├─ Leslie moments service
   └─ Character voice proxy

Browser UI
├─ Existing SillyTavern interface and event system
├─ Leslie desktop chat and settings layers
├─ Memory and moments extensions, including an isolated model-backed activity worker with persisted enthusiasm controls
└─ Character workshop and voice settings

Optional companion boundary
└─ Leslie Bridge v1
   ├─ Process-scoped bearer authentication
   ├─ Capability discovery
   ├─ OpenAI-compatible Volcengine speech adapter
   ├─ Active LeslieTavern character and chat binding
   ├─ Authoritative LeslieTavern turn streaming
   └─ Bound-character Volcengine speech

Local Windows launcher
├─ LeslieTavern-only mode
├─ LeslieTavern + AIRI mode
├─ Ephemeral shared Bridge token
└─ Build, diagnostics, logs, and safe tracked-process shutdown

Integrated source workspace
├─ One root Git repository and owned origin remote
├─ LeslieTavern npm package boundary
├─ airi/ pnpm package boundary
└─ No nested AIRI Git metadata or upstream remote
```

## Compatibility boundaries

- Existing SillyTavern chat events and storage formats remain authoritative.
- Leslie modules should be optional and fail open.
- Character cards, JSONL chats, group chats, World Info, swipes, and model adapters must remain usable.
- User data is local state and is not part of the source repository.
- Direct LAN web access may be enabled explicitly with an allowlist that follows the private subnet used for each connection and a trusted-network firewall boundary. Same-subnet devices do not need per-IP entries, while public and unrelated routed networks remain blocked. Device discovery, data synchronization, cloud synchronization, and automatic memory writes still require separate security and approval designs before implementation.
- The AIRI companion bridge is disabled by default and uses a process-scoped bearer token.
- AIRI sends only the newest user input. LeslieTavern remains authoritative for prompt assembly, generation, persistence, character selection, and voice selection. The boundary is documented in [airi-bridge.md](airi-bridge.md).

## Current maturity

The repository contains a runnable prototype with significant local verification. It is suitable for continued development and test distribution, but it is not yet a signed installer or a stable public release.

See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for planned work and [data-and-packaging.md](data-and-packaging.md) for repository boundaries.
